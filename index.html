                <p>
                    My name is Benjamin (Matt) Gaither. I am working on completeing a Full Stack Bootcamp that is offer by Michigan State
                     University and I am also in Jefferson State Community College working towards a degree. I decided to change my occupation 
                     when the pandemic started and took my job. I have worked in a customer service for the past two years and have learned a lot 
                     about engineering roles while working. I am a dedicated hard worker and I am never afraid to ask questions. I have been 
                     on the other side of the technology long enough to know and explain what would make hundreds of position easier for the 
                     company, which in turn will maximize productivity and decrease employee burn out. My experience in my current role will 
                     provide valuable insights and a fresh perspective to the engineering role. Personally, I am looking for a long term carreer 
                     in something I love to do and will excel at quickly. I hope you can how hard I work and the determination I put in the following projects
                     and how this will benefit the company.
